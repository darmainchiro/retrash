# retrash

Retrash is an application regarding recommendations for recycling waste by utilizing machine learning technology to see what waste can be used by users into handicrafts. There is also a feature that users can use to sell their trash to collectors around the user's location.

Procedure for use: 
1. The application will take a photo of the waste, for example, the bottle waste will then be read by Machine Learning, including what type of waste, then it will recommend what crafts can be made from it. 
2. There is also a time when users only want to sell their trash, they can use the Sell feature which will show the location of collectors around the user. Users can contact collectors so they can pick up trash at the user's location.
